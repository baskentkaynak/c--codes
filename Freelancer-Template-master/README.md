<p>
In this version, you'll find an Admin panel to edit all the site's content.
</p>
<p>
All the content are stored as JSON in the "data/data.txt" file - <strong>YOU DON'T NEED SQL !</strong>
</p>
<p>
The initial Admin username and password are :
<br/>
username: admin
<br/>
password: admin
<br/>
To change them, you'll have to edit their values in the web.config !
<br/>
To get the hashed password, you'll have to go to admin/generatepassword.aspx and get the hashed value.
</p>

<p>
The "Localfilespath" key in the Web.Config should be changed to you folder's location as well as the "MyEmail" key where you'll have to put your own email.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you'll need to give permission to the "data" and "images" folder.
</p>
